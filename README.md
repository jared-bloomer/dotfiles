## Description
These are my personal configurations I use for my local machine profile setup. I try to keep this up to date, but we all know how life is, sometimes things get missed. 

## Work Profile Settings
Create the file `$HOME/.workrc` and place all work related configurations in that file. It will automatically be sourced and loaded if the file exist.
