# Session Handoffs

## Goal
Document context in extreme detail to prepare for a new chat session to continue work from the same exact point in time. 

## Constraints
- Session data should be documented in a file named `session-handoff.md`.
- 1 `session-hadoff.md` file should be used for each feature of work.
- The contents of the `session-handoff.md` should be completely replaced everytime the data is refreshed or updated.
