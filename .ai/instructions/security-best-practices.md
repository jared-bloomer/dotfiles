# Security Best Practices

This document provides guidelines to ensure secure development and operations within this project. Follow these practices to minimize vulnerabilities and protect sensitive data.

## 1. Secret Management
- Never hardcode secrets, passwords, or API keys in source code.
- Use environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Rotate secrets regularly and remove unused credentials.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong authentication mechanisms (OAuth, SSO, etc.).
- Enforce least privilege: grant only necessary permissions.
- Validate user input and session tokens.

## 3. Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (TLS/SSL).
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs or error messages.

## 4. Dependency Management
- Use trusted sources for packages and libraries.

## 5. Secure Coding Practices
- Validate and sanitize all external inputs.
- Avoid using deprecated or insecure functions.
- Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive details.

## 6. Monitoring & Incident Response
- Enable logging and monitoring for security events.
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities.
